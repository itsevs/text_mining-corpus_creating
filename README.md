# text_mining-corpus_creating

This is the code I wrote for the 4th assignment of the course
''Information discovery in texts''
of the Masters Degree in Language Technologies

Basically, the code only requires a list of URLS from which we want to extrac information.
It extracts HTML code automatically and generates a corpus with key information from the web pages.
Several text processing tools are applied (tokenization, stemming -Porter's algorithm, elimination of repeated words, construction of a vocabulary).
Vectorial representations of texts and inverted file are made, according to two weight functions (a local one -tf- and a global one -tfidf-)

The code can also be found and tested here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bSSbN0VxADUg4HjaR_D8Wx6bjUvHzymw#scrollTo=BozHlRBUcBsH&uniqifier=1

Attached is the assignment written in LaTeX, where I comment the code step by step -in spanish-.

greetings,
